The reliability of a measurement depends on                    1)  precision          2)  accuracy          3)  systematic error   4)  random error               2.    The error due to resolution of a measuring instrument is                   1)  personal error     2)  random error      3)  systematic error   4)  gross error               3.    The error due to resolution of a measuring instrument is                   1)  least count error  2) permissible error  3)  systematic error   4)  all the above               4.    The random error which exists invariably in screw gauge                    1)  least count error  2) Zero error         3) gross error         4)  backlash error               5.    The errors which are estimated by statistical methods are                   1)  systematic errors  2)  random errors     3)  theoretical errors  4)  gross errors               6.    The measure of accuracy is                   1)  absolute error     2)  relative error    3)  percentage error   4)  both 2 and 3               7.    The decrease in percentage error                    1) increases the accuracy                                           2)  does not effect the                   accuracy                    3)  decreases the accuracy                                          4)  both 1 and 3               8.    Even when the measured quantity is not dimensionless, ……………of the following is a dimensionless                   error                    1)  gross error        2)  absolute error    3)  instrumental error  4)  relative error               9.    Mean value – Measured value gives                   1)  absolute error     2)  relative error    3)  random error       4)  gross error               10.   The errors that always occur in the measurement with screw gauge is                    1)  random errors      2)  systematic errors  3)  gross errors      4)  negligible errors               11.   A physicist performs an experiment and takes 200 readings. He repeats the same experiment and now                   takes 800 readings. By doing so                   1) the probable error remains same           2) the probable error is four times                   3) the probable error is halved              4) the probable error is reduced by a factor ¼               12.   The Last digit in the measurement gives the first. ………digit                   1)  certain            2)  significant       3)  uncertain          4)  insignificant","PHYSICS  —  MEASUREMENTS UNITS AND DIMENSIONS (MAINS)                                             [2]              13.   More the number of significant figures shows more the                    1)  accuracy           2)  error             3) number of figures   4)  value               14.   If a measured quantity has n significant figures, the reliable digits in it are                   1) n                   2)  n-1               3)  2n                 4)  n/2               15.   If the significant figures are more,                   1) percentage error is more and accuracy is less  2) percentage error is less and accuracy is more                   3) percentage error is less and accuracy is less  4) percentage error is more and accuracy is more               16.   The mathematical operation in which the accuracy is limited to least accurate term is                   1) addition                                  2) subtraction                    3)  multiplication \& division                4)  both 1 and 2               17.

Two full turns of the circular scale of a screw gauge cover a distance of 1 mm on its main scale. The total                   number of divisions on the circular scale is 50. Further, its is found that the screw gauge has a zero error                   of -0.03 mm. While measuring the diameter of a thin wire, a student notes the main scale reading of 3 mm                   and the number of circular scale divisions in line with the main scale as 35.

To  keep  a  particle  moving with constant     velocity  on a  frictionless  surface,  an  external  force                   1) should act continuously                   2) should  be  a  variable  force                    3) not  necessary                            4) should act  opposite to the direction of motion               2.   Frictional  force  between  two bodies                    1) Adds  the motion between the bodies                   2) Destroys the relative  motion between the bodies                   3) Sometimes  helps  and sometimes  opposes  the motion                    4) Increases  the relative velocity  between  the bodies                3.   A  good  lubricant should  be highly                   1) Viscous             2) Non-volatile       3) Both                4) Transparent               4.    Theoretically which  of the  following are best  lubricants                   1) Solids              2) Liquids            3) Gases               4) Both 2 and 3               5.    When a moving body  is suddenly stopped                   1) Frictional  force  increases                    2) Roughness  is found on the road                   3) Tyres of the  vehicles burst                   4) The frictional  force  reduces to zero  as  it is a  self  adjusting force               6.    A  block  ‘B’  rests  on ‘A’.  A  rests  on  a horizontal  surface  ‘C’  which is frictionless.  There  is friction                   between A and B.  If ‘B’  is pulled  to the right                   1) B  moves forward  and A  to the left      2) ‘B’  only moves  to the left                    3) ‘B’ does  not move                        4) ‘A’  and ‘B’ move  together  to the right              7.    Sand  is dusted to the railway  tracks  during rainy season to                    1) Make  it always  wet                      2) Increase  friction                   3) To  reduce  consumption of fuel           4) Make it always dry               8..   With increase  of temperature,  the frictional  force  acting  between two surfaces                   1) Increases                                 2) Decreases                    3) Remains same                              4) May  increase or decrease               9.    If we imagine  ideally  smooth  surfaces  and if they  are kept  in contact,  the frictional force  acting                   between them is                    1) Zero                                      2) A finite  value but not zero                   3) Very large                                4) We can’t  predict","PHYSICS  —  FRICTION (MAINS)                                                                       [128]              10.   If man is walking,  direction of friction is                    1) Opposite  to direction of motion          2) Same as  that  of direction of motion                   3) Perpendicular to  that of direction of motion  4) 45º to the direction  of motion               11.   Aeroplanes are  streamlined  to reduce                   1) fluid friction      2) sliding  friction  3) kinetic  friction   4) limiting friction               12.   If  an external force and the frictional  force  acting on a body  cancel  each other  the frictional force is                   1) Rolling friction    2) Sliding friction   3) Static  friction    4) Normal reaction               13.   A  high pressure tyre rolls more  easily  than a low  pressure tyre because                    1) Friction  is less in  high  inflated  tyre  2) Friction is more in high inflated tyre                   3) Friction is zero in high pressure tyre    4) Produces  force  in the forward  direction               14.   An aircraft  of mass ‘m’  travels  through a distance ‘s’ on a  run way  having a coefficient of friction  ‘m’                   takes  off  with  a velocity  ‘v’  in ‘t’  sec.

The limiting friction between two surfaces  does  not depend                   1) on the nature  of two surfaces            2) on normal reaction                    3) on the weight  of the body                4) on volume  of the body               16.   While  walking  on ice one should take  small steps  to avoid  slipping.  This is because  smaller  steps                   ensure                    1) larger  friction    2) smaller  friction  3) larger  normal force  4) smaller normal force              17.   In order  to  stop  a car  in shortest  distance  on a horizontal road,  one should                    1) apply  the  brakes  very hard so that the wheels  stop rotating                   2) apply  the brakes  hard enough  to just prevent slipping                   3) pump  the  brakes  (press and release)    4) shut  the engine off  and not apply brakes               18.   A body  rests on a rough  horizontal plane.  A  force  is applied  to the body  directed  towards  the plane                   at an angle   θ  with  the vertical.  The body  can be moved  along the plane                    1) only if  θ   is  greater  than the angle of friction  2) only if  θ  is  lesser  than the angle of friction                    3) only if  θ   is  equal  to  the angle of friction  4) for all  values of   θ               19.   A  block  of mass  M slides  down a rough inclined  plane of height h through  a slope distances.  If  F be                   the force  of friction then kinetic  energy  at  the bottom will be                   1) Mgh                 2) MgS                3) Mgh + FS            4) Mgh – FS               20.

Newton's first law of motion leads to the concept of                    1) force               2) inertia            3) both                4) temperature              2.    When an athelet takes part in a long jump he runs for a while and then jumps.  This is because                    1) inertia of motion helps him to take a longer jump                   2) running for a time makes him alert                    3) it is a rule that one should run before he jumps   4) he wants to show his physical power              3.    A man is trying to swim across the river.  Then he should spend maximum energy in                    1) first one third of the journey            2) second one third of the journey                   3) last one third of the journey             4) Equal in all cases               4.    Newton's second law of motion give                   1) magnitude of force  2) definition of force  3) concept of inertia  4) all the above               5.    A boat with a sail has an electric fan inside.  When the fan works, due to it the boat                   1) cannot move                               2) can move                   3) it depends on wind directions             4) it depends on the speed of the fan               6.    A cricketer draws his hands backwards to catch the ball, because                   1) by increasing the time in which he stops the ball, he reduces the force on his hands                    2) by increasing the distance, he allows the ball to travel a greater distance for more runs                   3) it is an art to catch the ball                   4) it is a rule in circket               7.    Impulse is equal to                   1) momentum                                  2) change in momentum                    3) rate of change of momentum                4) rate of change of force               8.    A body is projected vertically upwards.  Its momentum is gradually decreasing.  In this                   1) it is a violation of law of conservation of linear momentum                   2) momentum of the body alone gets conserved                   3) momentum of the body, earth and air molecules together remains constant                    4) violates law of conservation of energy               9.    If a stationary bomb explodes into pieces, then                   1) momentum increases                        2) momentum decreases                   3) kinetic energy increases                  4) kinetic energy decreases","PHYSICS  —  COLLISIONS (MAINS)                                                               [230]              10.   If a stationary bomb explodes into pieces, then                    1) momentum remains constant                 2) momentum decreases                   3) kinetic energy remains constant           4) both (1) and (3)              11.   If a stationary bomb explodes into two pieces of unequal masses, then                    1) both will have the same kinetic energy    2) bigger piece will have greater kinetic energy                   3) smaller piece will have greater kinetic energy  4) bigger piece will have greater momentum               12.   Conservation of linear momentum is equivalent to                   1) Newton's first law of motion              2) Newton's second law of motion                    3) Newton's third law of motion              4) Newton's law of gravitation              13.   The horizontal component of weight                    1) is always zero                            2) is always equal to the weight                   3) is less than the weight, but is not zero  4) depends upon the angle of longitude              14.   Jet plane works on the principal of conservation of                    1) mass                2) energy             3) linear momentum     4) angular momentum              15.   A shell initially at rest explodes into two pieces of unequal masses.  Then the two pieces will                   1) fly in opposite direction with same velocity                    2) fly in opposite direction with same kinetic energy                   3) fly in opposite direction with same momentum                   4) fly in the same direction with same momentum               16.   The area of force and time graph represents                   1) impulse                                   2) change in momentum                   3) both (1) and (2)                          4) work               17.   A metal ball and a rubber ball both having the same mass strikes a wall normally with the same velocity.  The                   rubber ball rebounds and the metal ball does not rebound.  It can be concluded that                   1) the rubber ball suffers greater change in  momentum                    2) the iron ball suffers greater change in momentum                   3) both suffers the same change in momentum                   4) none of the above               18.
